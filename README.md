# vanilla-beans

Collection of vanilla ES6 JavaScript libraries and boilerplates for fast prototyping of browser-based games and
interactive experiences, mostly useful for game jams.

Designed with minimal coupling, most libraries can be used on their own and included into any architecture.

Features optional libraries that utilize DOM as graphics engine, for those who feel comfortable working with standard HTML and CSS, and projects that do not need benefits of GPU rendering libraries.

## Installation

- Option 1: Download the compiled release and include minimized .js and .css files into your HTML page 
- Option 2: Clone the repo, remove libraries that you don't need and build your own release `npm run build`
- Option 3: Or just copy whatever code you need into your project

## Demos
